## About the Video Course
Welcome to this comprehensive course on website and web application hacking! In this course, you will start as a beginner with no previous knowledge about penetration testing or hacking. This course is focused on the practical side of penetration testing without neglecting the theory behind each attack. Before jumping into penetration testing, you will first learn how to set up a lab and install the required software to practice penetration testing on your own machine. Then you will learn about websites, how they work, what they rely on, what is meant by a web server, a database, and how all of these components work together to give us functioning websites. Once you understand how websites work we will start talking about how can we exploit these components and this method of communication to carry out a number of powerful attacks. This course will take you from a beginner to a more advanced level. By the time you finish, you will be able to launch attacks and test the security of websites and web applications in exactly the same way that black hat hackers would do, fix these vulnerabilities, and secure websites from them. All the attacks in this course are practical attacks that work against any real websites. For each vulnerability you will learn the basic exploitation, then you will learn advanced methods that will give you more privileges or allow you to bypass security measurements.
